This control is based on the [datepicker-ios](https://github.com/ccwasden/datepicker-ios) control combined with the [KNSemiModalViewController](https://github.com/kentnguyen/KNSemiModalViewController).

The original controller was not aware of orientation changes and was missing some customization features that I needed for my project, so I decided to rewrite part of the controller to fit to my needs
